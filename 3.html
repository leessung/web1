<h2>Java script</h2> <!--h태그:제목-->
<p>The Javanese script, natively known as Aksara Jawa (ꦲaꦏ꧀ꦱksaꦫraꦗjaꦮwa) and Hanacaraka (ꦲhaꦤnaꦕcaꦫraꦏka), formally known as Déntawyanjana (ꦢꦺdéꦤ꧀ꦠntaꦮꦾwyaꦚ꧀ꦗnyjaꦤna) and Carakan (ꦕcaꦫraꦏkaꦤ꧀n), is an abugida developed by the Javanese people to write several Austronesian languages spoken in Indonesia, primarily the Javanese language and an early form of Javanese called Kawi, as well as Sanskrit, an Indo-Aryan language used as a sacred language throughout Asia. The Javanese script is a descendant of the Brahmi script and therefore has many similarities with the modern scripts of South India and Southeast Asia. The Javanese script, along with the Balinese script, is considered the most elaborate and ornate among Brahmic scripts of Southeast Asia.[1]
